# Milestone Project 1
This is a photographer's website. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices. 
My client and I had discussed thoroughly the look  and the purpose of the website, so I designed it with the thought of having a simple and eye-catching webpage. The aim of the project is to show his works and find clients.

## Design
- Colour Scheme: The main colours used are black, white and grey. My client takes black&white pictures so I decided to follow his style.
- Typography: The main font used is Arial for the whole website with Helvetica and san-serif as fallback font in case the main fonts is not imported into the site correctly.

## Known Bugs
<img src="assets/images/readme/navbar-tablet.jpg" width=800 height=200>
<img src="assets/images/readme/navbar-phone.jpg" width=600 height=300>

On the Tablet screen, the Brand-title is not aligned with the navbar.
On the Phone screen, the header is not centered.

I have used display property flex for the header. I've been looking for a solution several times but couldn't find it. 

On the gallery.html I have change the section element with a div as suggested from W3C Marckup Validator.

## Deployment
I used GitHub to deploy this website. The steps to deploy it are the following:
1. GitHub Repository
2. Setting
3. GitHub Pages
4. Under "Source" click the dropdown called "None" and chose "main branch".
5. The page will refresh on its own
6. Scroll down through the page to locate the now-publish site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
